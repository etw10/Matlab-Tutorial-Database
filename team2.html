            Students learn most effectively when collaborating with other students. More ideas are talked about; therefore, the students in the group will obtain more knowledge regarding the topic. In the video students are working together, and another student is attempting to work by himself. After asking if he can join them, he finds that the content gets more clear because of the other students working with him.

            Rules are best when the professor and the students are in agreement with them. The best way for that to happen is students helping make the rules and guidelines early on in the year. In the video the students and the professor actively engaged in creating rules which will avoid misunderstandings in the future.

            To maintain a positive and effective learning environment professors must address bad behavior quickly. Note that falling asleep is not the only bad behavior that can occur. Also take note how the professor established that it was wrong quickly to keep the class moving forward.
